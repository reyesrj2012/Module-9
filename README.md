# Module-9 Weather Application

## Creating a Weather Application

The application's front end has already been created. The application should connect the front end and back end. Then deployy the entire application to Render. 

The base url should look like the following: 
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}

You must go to the base url to register for an API key.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.



## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
